## NOTE:
The colors of all the arrows will change together when the game loads.<br>
You can optionally change the arrow color settings after loading the game, but the arrows you fire, the arrows you inspect, and other arrows you interfere with will be individual instances. So those colors don't change when you change the settings.<br>
They will all have the same color settings the next time the game is saved and then loaded.
