## NOTE:
The colors of all the arrows will change together when the game loads.<br>
You can optionally change the arrow color settings after loading the game, but the arrows you fire, the arrows you inspect, and other arrows you interfere with will be individual instances. So those colors don't change when you change the settings.<br>
The next time you load the game / load the scene (such as going in and out of a building), all arrows will have the same color settings.
